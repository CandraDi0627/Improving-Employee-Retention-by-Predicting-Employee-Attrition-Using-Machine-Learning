# Improving-Employee-Retention-by-Predicting-Employee-Attrition-Using-Machine-Learning

In this Mini Project, I act as a member of the Data Scientist team at a technology start-up company. The company is currently experiencing big problems, many employees have submitted their resignations but the company has not yet taken a decision on this matter. Help the company to explain the current condition of its employees, as well as explore the problems within the company that cause employees to resign so that they can reduce the rate of employee resignations, and can outline a strategy that can increase employee retention. You can present descriptive findings from data using data visualization and data storytelling, and can get inferential findings using statistical analysis or machine learning approaches with frameworks such as Interpretable & Explainable AI to convert model findings into a story.
